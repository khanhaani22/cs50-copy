        Jump over an opponents checker to remove it from the play area, only diagonally.

    Tips:
        It is best to move your pieces together to avoid being jumped over.
        Play offensively, but not too upfront.
        Keep the back row full for as long as you can.
        Sacrifice pieces when necessary.
